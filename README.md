## Gameplay Overview

A competitive player vs player turn-based game. The objective is to strategically advance units across the map to reach and attack the opposing player. A player has won once a player has done enough damage to the opponent. Players can summon units that can move across the map. A gameplay mechanic based on chance will allow a player to create new paths on the map, travel through existing ones, or attack enemy units.
